# notes
This repository is used as a knowledge base for various things that I come across when developing or testing systems.
You can not remember everything. This is also true for what you have made yourself.
These notes might be helpful for others, but will also contain essential notes for myself :).

# Structure
At the moment all notes are maintained in the wiki of this repository(https://github.com/Krien/notes/wiki). At some point I want to convert them to org mode files and properly separate them into different sections.
